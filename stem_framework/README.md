# STEM framework

STEM framework is a framework I don't know yet what is for.

## Development installation
We use `conda` from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) for package and development environment management.



Create a virtual environment (if you wish) by running
```
conda env create -f conda-env.yml 
```
To activate this environment, use
```
conda activate stem-framework-dev
```
